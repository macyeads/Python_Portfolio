# Eads_Python_Portfolio
This is the portfolio of PYTHON code that I learned during BISC 450C.
My name is Macy Eads and I am a senior at LA Tech with plans to graduate in Winter 2026. I plan to attend medical school following graduation (pending my acceptance). I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and have learned many things when it comes to Python. If I do not use this immediately in my future, I know that if a time comes that I need to use it that I will be prepared!
